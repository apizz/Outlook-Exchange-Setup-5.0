# Outlook Exchange Setup 5
*Â© Copyright 2008-2018 [William Smith](mailto:bill@talkingmoose.net)*

## Purpose
Outlook Exchange Setup 5 provides your Outlook 2016 for Mac users with automatic setups of their Exchange accounts. It works especially well if the Mac is bound to Active Directory.

## Download
You'll always find the latest release here: https://github.com/talkingmoose/Outlook-Exchange-Setup-5/releases/latest

## Support
**Software Versions**
Office 2016 for Mac requires OS X 10.10 Yosemite or higher. Therefore, this script supports only OS X 10.10 and higher.

**Report Issues**
Use GitHub's [Issues page for this project](https://github.com/jamfprofessionalservices/CIS-for-macOS-Sierra/issues) or email me at bill@talkingmoose.net. I will make every effort to answer questions about the scripts and work to correct bugs you may find.

## Suggestions
If you find this script useful or have ideas for improving it, please let me know. It is intended for use with volume license editions of Office 2016 for Mac. Office 365 customers should not disable Outlook's startup windows because users need to activate the software prior to connecting to their Exchange Online accounts and Autodiscover should already work correctly.
